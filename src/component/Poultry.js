            <h1>POULTRY FARMING</h1>
            <p>Poultry farming is the raising of domesticated birds such as
		chickens, ducks, turkeys and geese for the purpose of farming meat or
		eggs for food. Poultry are farmed in great numbers with chickens being
		the most numerous. More than 50 billion chickens are raised annually
		as a source of food, for both their meat and their eggs. Chickens
		raised for eggs are usually called layers while chickens raised for
		meat are often called broilers. In the US, the national organization
		overseeing poultry production is the Food and Drug</p>

    <h2>Egg-laying chickens – husbandry systems</h2>
    <p>Commercial hens usually begin laying eggs at 16–20 weeks of age,
		although production gradually declines soon after from approximately
		25 weeks of age. This means that in many countries, by approximately
		72 weeks of age, flocks are considered economically unviable and are
		slaughtered after approximately 12 months of egg production, although
		chickens will naturally live for 6 or more years. In some countries,
		hens are force moulted to re-invigorate egg-laying.
	</p>
    <p>Environmental conditions are often automatically controlled in
		egg-laying systems. For example, the duration of the light phase is
		initially increased to prompt the beginning of egg-laying at 16–20
		weeks of age and then mimics summer day length which stimulates the
		hens to continue laying eggs all year round; normally, egg production
		occurs only in the warmer months. Some commercial breeds of hen can
		produce over 300 eggs a year</p>
        <h2>Free-range</h2>
	<p>Free-range poultry farming allows chickens to roam freely for a
		period of the day, although they are usually confined in sheds at
		night to protect them from predators or kept indoors if the weather is
		particularly bad. In the UK, the Department for Environment, Food and
		Rural Affairs (Defra) states that a free-range chicken must have
		day-time access to open-air runs during at least half of its life.
		Unlike in the United States, this definition also applies to
		free-range egg laying hens. The European Union regulates marketing
		standards for egg farming which specifies a minimum condition for
		free-range eggs that "hens have continuous daytime access to open-air
		runs, except in the case of temporary restrictions imposed by
		veterinary authorities". The RSPCA "Welfare standards for laying hens
		and pullets" indicates that the stocking rate must not exceed 1,000
		birds per hectare (10 m2 per hen) of range available and a minimum
		area of overhead shade/shelter of 8 m2 per 1,000 hens must be
		provided.</p>
        <p>Free-range farming of egg-laying hens is increasing its share of
		the market. Defra figures indicate that 45% of eggs produced in the UK
		throughout 2010 were free-range, 5% were produced in barn systems and
		50% from cages. This compares with 41% being free-range in 2009.</p>
	<h1>Organic</h1>
	<p>In organic egg-laying systems, chickens are also free-range.
		Organic systems are based upon restrictions on the routine use of
		synthetic yolk colourants, in-feed or in-water medications, other food
		additives and synthetic amino acids, and a lower stocking density and
		smaller group sizes.[citation needed] The Soil Association standards
		used to certify organic flocks in the UK, indicate a maximum outdoors
		stocking density of 1,000 birds per hectare and a maximum of 2,000
		hens in each poultry house. In the UK, organic laying hens are not
		routinely beak-trimmed.</p>
        <h1>Battery cage</h1>
	<p>The majority of hens in many countries are reared in battery
		cages, although the European Union Council Directive 1999/74/EC has
		banned the conventional battery cage in EU states from January 2012.
		These are small cages, usually made of metal in modern systems,
		housing 3 to 8 hens. The walls are made of either solid metal or mesh,
		and the floor is sloped wire mesh to allow the faeces to drop through
		and eggs to roll onto an egg-collecting conveyor belt. Water is
		usually provided by overhead nipple systems, and food in a trough
		along the front of the cage replenished at regular intervals by a
		mechanical chain.</p>
	<p>The cages are arranged in long rows as multiple tiers, often
		with cages back-to-back (hence the term 'battery cage'). Within a
		single shed, there may be several floors containing battery cages
		meaning that a single shed may contain many tens of thousands of hens.
		Light intensity is often kept low (e.g. 10 lux) to reduce feather
		pecking and vent pecking. Benefits of battery cages include easier
		care for the birds, floor eggs which are expensive to collect are
		eliminated, eggs are cleaner, capture at the end of lay is expedited,
		generally less feed is required to produce eggs, broodiness is
		eliminated, more hens may be housed in a given house floor space,
		internal parasites are more easily treated, and labor requirements are
		generally much reduced.</p>
	<p>In farms using cages for egg production, there are more birds
		per unit area; this allows for greater productivity and lower food
		costs. Floor space ranges upwards from 300 cm2 per hen. EU standards
		in 2003 called for at least 550 cm2 per hen.In the US, the current
		recommendation by the United Egg Producers is 67 to 86 in2 (430 to 560
		cm2) per bird. The space available to battery hens has often been
		described as less than the size of a piece of A4 paper. Animal welfare
		scientists have been critical of battery cages because they do not
		provide hens with sufficient space to stand, walk, flap their wings,
		perch, or make a nest, and it is widely considered that hens suffer
		through boredom and frustration through being unable to perform these
		behaviours. This can lead to a wide range of abnormal behaviours, some
		of which are injurious to the hens or their cagemates.</p>
