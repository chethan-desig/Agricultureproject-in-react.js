            <p>Goat farming is the raising and breeding of domestic goats
		(Capra aegagrus hircus). It is a branch of animal husbandry. Goats are
		raised principally for their meat, milk, fibre and skin. Goat farming
		can be very suited to production with other livestock such as sheep
		and cattle on low-quality grazing land. Goats efficiently convert
		sub-quality grazing matter that is less desirable for other livestock
		into quality lean meat. Furthermore, goats can be farmed with a
		relatively small area of pasture and limited resources</p>
	<h2>USES</h2>
	<h3>Meat</h3>
	<p>three-quarters of the global population eat goat meat. It
		comprises 10% of worldwide meat consumption and 60% of red meat.</p>

	<p>Goat meat contains low amounts of saturated fatty acids and
		cholesterol. It is considered to be a healthier alternative to other
		types of red meat.[4]</p>
	<p>The taste of goat kid meat has been reported as similar to that
		of spring lamb meat.[5]</p>
	<p>In some localities (e.g. the Caribbean, Bangladesh, Pakistan and
		India) the word “mutton” is used to describe both goat and lamb meat.
		However, some compare the taste of goat meat to veal or venison,
		depending on the age and condition of the goat. The flavour is
		primarily linked to the presence of 4-methyloctanoic and
		4-methylnonanoic acid.[6][7]
	</p>
	<p>Goat meat can be prepared in a variety of ways, including
		stewing, baking, grilling, barbecuing, canning, and frying; it can be
		minced, curried, or made into sausage. Because of its low fat content,
		the meat can toughen at high temperatures if cooked without additional
		moisture. One of the most popular goats farmed for meat is the South
		African Boer, introduced into the United States in the early 1990s.
		The New Zealand Kiko is also considered a meat breed, as is the
		myotonic or "fainting goat"</p>
	<h3>Milk, butter and cheese</h3>
	<p>Goats produce about 2% of the world's total annual milk
		supply.[8] Some goats are bred specifically for milk. Unprocessed goat
		milk has small, well-emulsified fat globules, which means the cream
		remains suspended in the milk instead of rising to the top, as in
		unprocessed cow milk; therefore, it does not need to be homogenized.
		Indeed, if goat milk is to be used to make cheese, homogenization is
		not recommended, as this changes the structure of the milk, affecting
		the culture's ability to coagulate the milk and the final quality and
		yield of cheese.[9] Dairy goats in their peak milk production
		(generally around the third or fourth lactation cycle) average—2.7 to
		3.6 kg (6 to 8 lb)—of milk production daily—roughly 2.8 to 3.8 l (3 to
		4 U.S. qt)—during a ten-month lactation, producing more just after
		freshening and gradually dropping in production toward the end of
		their lactation. The milk generally averages 3.5% butterfat.</p>
	<p>Goat milk is commonly processed into cheese, butter, ice cream,
		yogurt, cajeta and other products. Goat cheese is known as fromage de
		chèvre ("goat cheese") in France. Some varieties include Rocamadour
		and Montrachet.[11] Goat butter is white because goats produce milk
		with the yellow beta-carotene converted to a colourless form of
		vitamin A.</p>
	<p>Male goats are generally not required for the dairy-goat
		industry and are usually slaughtered for meat soon after birth. In the
		UK, approximately 30,000 billy goats from the dairy industry are
		slaughtered each year</p>
	<h3>Fibre</h3>
	<p>Most goats have soft insulating hairs near the skin and longer
		guard hairs on the surface. The desirable fibre for the textile
		industry is the former; it has several names including "down",
		"cashmere" and "pashmina". The guard hairs are of little value as they
		are too coarse, difficult to spin and difficult to dye.</p>
	<p>Goats are typically shorn twice a year, with an average yield of
		about 4.5 kg (10 lb). In South Asia, cashmere is called "pashmina"
		(from Persian pashmina, "fine wool"). In the 18th and early 19th
		centuries, Kashmir (then called Cashmere by the British), had a
		thriving industry producing shawls from goat-hair imported from Tibet
		and Tartary through Ladakh.</p>
	<p>The shawls were introduced into Western Europe when the General
		in Chief of the French campaign in Egypt (1799–1802) sent one to
		Paris. Since these shawls were produced in the upper Kashmir and
		Ladakh region, the wool came to be known as "cashmere". The cashmere
		goat produces a commercial quantity of cashmere wool, which is one of
		the most expensive natural fibres commercially produced; cashmere is
		very fine and soft.</p>
	<p>The cashmere goat fibre is harvested once a year, yielding
		around 260 g (9 oz) of down. Angora goats produce long, curling,
		lustrous locks of mohair. Their entire body is covered with mohair and
		there are no guard hairs. The locks constantly grow to 9 cm or more in
		length. Angora crossbreeds, such as the pygora and the nigora, have
		been selected to produce mohair and/or cashgora on a smaller,
		easier-to-manage animal.</p>
